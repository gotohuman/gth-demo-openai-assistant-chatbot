### Fueling Guidelines

#### Fueling Procedures
All vehicles in our fleet come with a full tank of fuel. Users are expected to return the vehicle with a full tank. If the vehicle is not refueled before return, a refueling fee will be charged, along with the cost of the fuel.

#### Fuel Types
It is crucial to use the correct fuel type specified in the vehicle details within the app. Most of our vehicles run on regular unleaded gasoline, but larger vehicles and trucks may require diesel. Always refer to the fuel cap or inside the vehicle for accurate fuel type information.
